# Steps to install on Windows (temporary)

- unzip mdvis.zip  (by hand if you don't have unzip installed)

- Enjoy :)

ï¼Š If the program won't start, you will have to install the MSVC Redistributable [here](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

You can start the program by executing mdvis.exe, or by adding the folder to your PATH and typing `mdvis` in the command prompt.
